# TODO

## Email Deliverability

- [ ] Evaluate BIMI later for sender logo display in supported inboxes.
  - Requires DMARC enforcement with `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` and `pct=100`.
  - Requires a BIMI-compatible SVG logo hosted over HTTPS.
  - Gmail generally requires a CMC or VMC certificate.
  - Not needed for the current Resend setup; keep current priority on SPF/DKIM/DMARC basics and stable sending reputation.

## Product Ideas

- [ ] Analyze uploaded invoices/receipts with AI to prefill financial entries.
  - Extract amount, date, supplier, document type, suggested category, and project/folder suggestion.
  - Let the user review and confirm before creating or updating a `FinancialEntry`.
  - Keep the original document linked as the archive/proof.
